# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for contributing to the Speech Emotion Recognition project!  
Please follow these guidelines to maintain clean and scalable code.

---

## Branching Strategy
- All new work should be done in feature branches:

- Examples:
- `feature/mfcc-extraction`
- `feature/cnn-model-training`

- Once complete, open a Pull Request (PR) into `main`.

---

## Commit Message Style
Write clean and meaningful commit messages in **present tense**:

Examples:
- `Add MFCC extraction script`
- `Fix shape mismatch in CNN model`
- `Update README with dataset instructions`

Avoid messages like:
- `done changes` ❌  
- `fixed everything` ❌  

---

## Code Style Guidelines
- Follow **PEP8** for Python
- Add docstrings and comments for important functions
- Avoid unused imports and dead code
- Format with tools like `black` or `autopep8` if possible

---

## Issues
Before starting a task:
- Check existing Issues
- If not found, **create a new Issue**
- Assign yourself or your teammate

Label example:
- `enhancement`
- `bug`
- `documentation`

---

## Testing (optional but good practice)
- Test scripts using sample audio before pushing
- Ensure training & evaluation scripts run without errors
